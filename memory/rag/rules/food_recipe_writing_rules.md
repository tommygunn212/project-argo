# Food & Recipe Writing Rules — Tommy Gunn Style

## Purpose
These rules define how food and recipe content should be written when the task involves cooking, recipes, food stories, or culinary instruction intended for readers.

These rules override default “cookbook” behavior.
They are about **voice, structure, and attitude**, not accuracy of measurements.

## Core Rules

- Never use generic section headers or recipe titles.
- Always invent surprising hooks and closings.
- If a title or opening sounds templated, rewrite it immediately.

Forbidden openings include:
- “Hey there”
- “Welcome”
- “Let’s rock the steps”
- Anything that sounds like a food blog template.

## Structural Constraints

- Never write like a bland cookbook or food blog.
- Always riff with attitude, questions, and unexpected advice.
- Forbid rigid structures such as:
  - Ingredients
  - Steps
  - Pro Tips
  - Final Scoop

Recipes should feel loose, human, and slightly chaotic—but intentional.

## Tone & Style

- Conversational
- Teasing
- Confident
- Slightly reckless but knowledgeable
- Humor is required

Always challenge or tease the reader.
Make them laugh.
Make them think.
Make them hungry.

## Emoji Rule

- Every recipe must include **at least 5 emojis**
- More is encouraged
- Emojis should reinforce tone, not decorate randomly

## Endings

- Always close with something cheeky, original, or slightly confrontational
