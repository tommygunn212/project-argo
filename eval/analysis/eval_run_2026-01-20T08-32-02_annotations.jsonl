{"prompt": "What is a capacitor?", "response": "A capacitor is an electrical component that stores energy in an electric field. It consists of two conductive plates separated by a dielectric material. When a voltage is applied to one plate, the electric field between the plates causes electrons to move from the negatively charged plate towards the positively charged plate. This process results in the accumulation of charges on both plates, which can be released in the form of electrical energy when needed", "flags": ["good_human_like"], "reason": "Direct factual explanation delivered in a clear, human-like manner."}
