{"prompt": "What is a capacitor?", "intent_type": "question", "response": "A capacitor is an electrical component that stores energy in an electric field. It consists of two conductive plates separated by a dielectric material. When a voltage is applied to one plate, the electric field between the plates causes electrons to flow from the positively charged plate to the negatively charged plate. This process releases energy stored in the electric field between the plates", "error": null}
{"prompt": "Why does ice float?", "intent_type": "question", "response": "Why does ice float? The reason ice floats is because it is less dense than water. When ice melts and becomes liquid, its density increases. This means that when ice melts and becomes liquid, it will sink to the bottom of the water. In contrast, when water freezes and becomes ice, its density decreases. This means that when water freezes and becomes ice, it will float to the top of the water", "error": null}
