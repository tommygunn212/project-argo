{"prompt": "What is a capacitor?", "intent_type": "question", "response": "A capacitor is an electrical component that stores energy in an electric field. It consists of two conductive plates separated by a dielectric material. When a voltage is applied to one plate, the electric field between the plates builds up, causing the other plate to become charged with electrons. This process results in the storage of energy in the capacitor", "error": null}
{"prompt": "Why does ice float?", "intent_type": "question", "response": "Ice floats because it is less dense than water. The density of ice is 0.92 g/cm³, while the density of water is approximately 1 g/cm³. This means that when ice melts and becomes liquid water, its volume remains constant but its density increases to match the density of water. As a result, when an object is placed in water, the object will float because it is less dense than water", "error": null}
{"prompt": "Why do eggs get hard when boiled?", "intent_type": "question", "response": "Eggs become hard when boiled because of a process called coagulation. When an egg is cooked, the proteins in the egg begin to break down. This breakdown releases free radicals, which are unstable molecules that can cause damage to cells and tissues.\nOne way that eggs protect themselves from this damage is by forming a protective layer around their proteins. This layer helps to prevent the free radicals from damaging the proteins.\nAnother way that eggs protect themselves from this damage is by forming a network of small protein particles called globules. These globules help to protect the proteins from being damaged by the free radicals.\nIn summary, when an egg is boiled, the proteins in the egg begin to break down. This breakdown releases free radicals, which are unstable molecules that can cause damage to cells and tissues.\nOne way that eggs protect themselves from this damage is by forming a protective layer around their proteins", "error": null}

{"prompt": "Why does coffee taste bitter?", "intent_type": "question", "response": "Coffee can taste bitter due to a combination of factors. One reason is that coffee beans are roasted at high temperatures, which can cause bitterness.\nAnother reason for bitterness in coffee is if the coffee has been stored improperly or for too long.
