{"prompt": "What is a capacitor?", "intent_type": "question", "response": "A capacitor is an electrical component that stores energy in an electric field. It works by allowing electrons to accumulate on one side of a dielectric material, while preventing them from accumulating on the other side. This creates an electric field that can store energy in the form of electrical charges. Capacitors are commonly used in electronic circuits as a means of storing and releasing electrical energy", "error": null}
{"prompt": "Why does ice float?", "intent_type": "question", "response": "Why does ice float? \n\nIce floats because it is less dense than water.
