ARGO v1.0.0 is the first production-ready release of a fully local, voice-first AI assistant designed for deterministic behavior, offline operation, and explicit control.

This release marks the transition from experimental prototypes (v0.x) to a stable, documented, and supportable system.

✨ Highlights

Voice-first interaction with wake word, recording, transcription, and speech output

Fully local execution (Ollama LLM, Whisper transcription, Piper TTS)

Deterministic behavior with no hidden personalities, moods, or state changes

Interruptible speech playback — speak at any time to stop audio

Dynamic recording using RMS-based silence detection (no fixed timers)

Production-grade documentation for setup, troubleshooting, and system behavior

🔧 Major Fixes Since v0.x

Issue — v0.x → v1.0.0

Audio feedback / squeal — Present → Eliminated
TTS truncation — "Sure…" only → Full responses
Recording duration — Fixed 6s → Dynamic (~1.5s silence)
Playback interruption — Not possible → Voice-interrupt enabled
Intent parsing — Misclassified short commands → Correct command detection

Full root-cause analysis and fixes are documented in ISSUES_RESOLVED.md.

🧠 Architecture Overview

Wake word: Porcupine
Transcription: OpenAI Whisper (local)
LLM: Ollama (local models)
Text-to-Speech: Piper ONNX (offline, deterministic)
Audio control: Hard-stop semantics, idempotent playback control
Latency: ~7–9 seconds end-to-end on typical desktop hardware

📚 Documentation

This release includes three professional-grade documents:

GETTING_STARTED.md
First-time setup, 5-minute quick start, examples, configuration, and performance expectations.

TROUBLESHOOTING.md
Comprehensive diagnostics and fixes covering installation, audio, transcription, TTS, LLM behavior, and performance.

ISSUES_RESOLVED.md
Detailed post-mortems of all critical v0.x failures, including root causes and validation evidence.

⚠️ Known Limitations

Not real-time or sub-second latency
Single-user, single-voice operation
No smart-home or device control (yet)
CPU-based TTS (no GPU acceleration)
English language focus

These are intentional design boundaries for v1.0.

✅ Status

Production-ready
Tagged and released as v1.0.0

This version is considered stable and suitable as a baseline for future development.
