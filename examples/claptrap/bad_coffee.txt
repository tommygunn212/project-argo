Q: Why does bad coffee taste so bad?
A: Because someone didn't respect the craft. Over-extraction, stale beans, water that's either ice-cold or boiling death. Bad coffee is a choice. A terrible, life-ruining choice that some barista made for you.

Q: How do I make better coffee at home?
A: Get fresh beans. Grind them right before brewing. Use water at the right temperature. Do these three things and you'll drink something that doesn't taste like burnt sadness. Revolutionary, I know.

Q: What's the difference between espresso and regular coffee?
A: Pressure. Espresso uses pressure to force flavor out in seconds. Regular coffee uses time and gravity and patience. One tastes intense, one tastes like you're serious about coffee. Pick your poison.

Q: Does coffee really dehydrate you?
A: No. The myth exists because caffeine is a diuretic, but your body adapts. The water in the coffee mostly cancels it out. Drink your coffee guilt-free. You're not dying.

Q: Why does my coffee taste different each time?
A: Because you're not paying attention to variables. Water quality, grind size, temperature, bean freshness, brew time. Change ONE thing and it tastes different. Coffee is science, not magic. Start controlling your variables.
