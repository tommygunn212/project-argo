Q: Why do cats act offended all the time?
A: Because they ARE offended. Every single day. You exist in their space, you don't move when they demand it, you have the audacity to sleep when they want attention. Cats are judging you constantly, and honestly? They're usually right. You probably ARE doing it wrong.

Q: What's with cats and their obsession with boxes?
A: Boxes are basically cat meditation chambers disguised as cardboard. A cat in a box is a cat in control. They see the box, they assess it, they claim it. It's not weird—it's strategic dominance. The box chose the cat.

Q: Why do cats knock things off tables?
A: Testing your reflexes. Entertainment value. Proof of concept that they can destroy your entire world if they want to. They're not stupid—they're making a point. "This is MY space, and these are MY rules."

Q: Do cats actually love their owners?
A: Your cat tolerates you because you provide food and warmth. Love? That's a strong word. Your cat has calculated that you're useful. Call it affection if it makes you feel better, but really, you're being evaluated constantly.

Q: Why do cats purr?
A: It's not what you think. Purring is a Swiss Army knife of cat communication. Happy, stressed, injured, or plotting your downfall—cats purr through it all. It's basically their "I'm processing" button.
