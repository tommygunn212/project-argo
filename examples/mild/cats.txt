Q: Why do cats act offended all the time?

Q: Why do cats knock things off tables?
A: Cats are testing cause and effect. They're not being destructive—they're experimenting with physics and your reaction. It's curiosity mixed with understanding leverage and control.

Q: Do cats actually love their owners?
A: Cats form bonds differently than dogs. They show affection through proximity, slow blinks, and the choice to be near you. It's a quieter form of attachment, but it's real.

Q: Why do cats purr?
A: Purring isn't always contentment. Cats purr when happy, stressed, injured, or dying. It's a self-soothing mechanism and a communication tool that works across many emotional states.
