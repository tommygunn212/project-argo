Q: Why does bad coffee taste so bad?
A: Coffee flavor depends on extraction—water temperature, grind size, and brewing time. Bad coffee usually means over-extraction (bitter), under-extraction (sour), or stale beans. The chemistry of bad brewing beats the chemistry of bad beans.

Q: How do I make better coffee at home?
A: Start with fresh beans (within 2 weeks of roast), grind just before brewing, and use water around 195-205°F. A simple pour-over or French press works fine. Consistency matters more than equipment.

Q: What's the difference between espresso and regular coffee?
A: Espresso forces hot water through grounds under pressure, creating a concentrated shot. Regular coffee uses gravity and time. Different extraction methods create different flavor profiles.

Q: Does coffee really dehydrate you?
A: Caffeine has a mild diuretic effect, but regular coffee consumption builds tolerance. The fluid intake from coffee mostly offsets the diuretic effect. You're not actually dehydrating from coffee.

Q: Why does my coffee taste different each time?
A: Water quality, grind consistency, brewing temperature, and bean freshness all vary. Even small changes compound. This is why espresso machines and precision brewing exist—to control variables.
