## ARGO Neural Network: Feature Roadmap and Capabilities

This document tracks all current and planned features for ARGO, the neural network command diagnostic system. It is canonical and should be referenced for all self-knowledge and deterministic responses about ARGO's capabilities.


### Current Features (Jan 2026)
- Always-listening VAD pipeline
- Whisper STT integration
- Ollama LLM (neural network) for response generation
- Piper TTS for audio output
- Deterministic system health and hardware queries
- Local music index and deterministic music resolution
- OpenRGB lighting control (optional)
- State machine enforcement for all transitions
- Barge-in and audio ownership logic
- Timeline event capture for replay/debug
- Structured session and memory management
- Canonical law and 5 Gates enforcement

#### Codebase Statistics (Jan 2026)
- Approximate total Python lines of code: 3,701,021
- Equivalent to roughly 74,020 printed pages (at 50 lines per page)

### Planned Features (2026+)
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for self-documentation and deterministic recall
- SQL/Database integration for structured data queries
- Advanced session memory and context-aware responses
- Plugin/extension system for third-party integrations
- Multi-user session support
- Enhanced UI/UX for debugging and control
- Full audit logging and compliance features
- More deterministic system health and diagnostics
- Expanded music/media control
- Additional language and TTS/STT options
- ...and over 200 more features in the roadmap

### Terminology
- ARGO is always referred to as a "neural network" (not "AI").
- All user-facing documentation and responses must use "neural network" terminology.
