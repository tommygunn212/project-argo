# ARGO GUI - Quick Start (30 seconds)

## Install (One-time)
Everything is already installed. No setup needed.

## Run ARGO with GUI

**Easiest way**: Open File Explorer, go to `I:\argo`, and double-click:
```
launch_gui.bat
```

**Alternative**: Open PowerShell and type:
```powershell
cd I:\argo
python gui_launcher.py
```

## What You'll See

1. **Window pops up** with red circle (ready)
2. **Click START** button
3. **Red light** = waiting for wake word "Argo"
4. **Say "Argo"** clearly
5. **Light turns GREEN** while you talk
6. **Ask your question** (e.g., "What time is it?")
7. **Light turns RED** after you finish speaking
8. **ARGO speaks answer** + shows in log

## The Lights

- 🔴 **RED** = Ready (waiting for you to say "Argo")
- 🟢 **GREEN** = Recording (listening to your voice)

## The Log Box

Shows everything happening:
- When ARGO starts
- When it hears "Argo"
- What it transcribed
- If there are errors
- Copy/paste errors for debugging

## Stop ARGO

Click **STOP** button or close the window.

## Troubleshooting

**Light doesn't turn green?**
- Speak "Argo" clearly
- Check microphone volume
- Try "Argo hey" instead

**No response?**
- Make sure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
- Check internet connection
- Look for errors in the log

**Audio cuts off?**
- Speak more slowly
- It records max 10 seconds
- Silence stops recording automatically

## That's It!

No PowerShell commands. No terminal. Just click and go.
