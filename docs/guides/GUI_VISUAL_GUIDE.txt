## Hot Spots

Things to watch in the log:

1. **"Recording started"** - Green light should turn on
2. **"Heard: ..."** - What ARGO understood you said
3. **"Intent: QUESTION"** - Type of request
4. **"Recording stopped"** - Red light should turn on
5. **"Response: ..."** - What ARGO will say
6. **"ERROR"** - Something went wrong (read the message)

## Tips

- Check log if something seems wrong
- Light changes are instant (< 100ms)
- Green light = CPU is processing audio
- Red light = Waiting or processing response
- Copy errors from log for debugging
