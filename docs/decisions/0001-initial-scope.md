# Decision 0001: Initial Project Scope

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Project Argo is being started as a new repository with no production requirements.
Early work is focused on establishing clean tooling, workflows, and documentation
before introducing core features or experiments.

Previous experience shows that projects without early structure tend to accumulate
technical debt, unclear intent, and undocumented decisions.

## Decision
The initial scope of Project Argo will prioritize:
- Repository structure
- Tooling and automation
- Documentation and decision logging
- Clear GitHub and VS Code workflows

Feature development is intentionally deferred until the foundation is stable.

## Consequences
- Early progress may feel slower due to upfront structure work
- Future development will benefit from clearer intent and reduced rework
- Decisions can be revisited with documented context rather than memory

This decision will be revisited once foundational tooling and documentation are stable.
