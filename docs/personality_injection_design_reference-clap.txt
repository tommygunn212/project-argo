PERSONALITY INJECTION — DESIGN REFERENCE (NON-EXECUTABLE)

NOTE:
This document is conceptual and NON-EXECUTABLE.

All personality behavior in Argo must be driven exclusively by
example-based imitation. No rules, heuristics, tone descriptors,
or abstract personality guidance in this document should be
implemented directly in code.

Qwen-class models do not reliably interpret intent, subtlety,
or tone instructions. They learn personality only through
concrete examples of completed responses.

This file exists for:
- Human reference
- Design rationale
- Future model upgrades (GPT-class, Claude-class, etc.)

It does NOT have execution authority.

------------------------------------------------------------

CORE PRINCIPLE

Personality is learned, not instructed.

Argo’s tone, humor, and manner of speech must emerge from
nearest-neighbor imitation of curated response examples.

If there is no example, Argo defaults to the Mild personality.

------------------------------------------------------------

SUPPORTED PERSONALITY MODES

1. Mild (Default)
2. Claptrap (Explicitly invoked only)

Personality modes are mutually exclusive.
No blending, interpolation, or automatic escalation is allowed.

------------------------------------------------------------

ACTIVATION RULES

- Mild is always active by default.
- Claptrap activates only when explicitly requested by the user
  (e.g. “Claptrap mode”, “Answer in Claptrap”, etc.).
- No personality inference or mood detection is permitted.

------------------------------------------------------------

STRUCTURAL RESPONSE SHAPE (REFERENCE ONLY)

Approved response shape (discovered via example selection):

1. One sharp or attention-grabbing opening sentence
2. Immediate grounding with a factual, calm explanation
3. Optional single pop culture reference
4. No joke stacking
5. No callbacks
6. No humor during commands, safety, or error handling

This structure must be demonstrated through examples,
not enforced through logic.

------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT NOT TO IMPLEMENT

- No tone flags
- No style parameters
- No adjective-based prompts (e.g. “sarcastic”, “playful”)
- No conditional humor logic
- No joke counters
- No temperature hacks
- No response rewriting for personality purposes

Corrections may adjust content, length, or framing,
but must preserve the original personality shape.

------------------------------------------------------------

CANONICAL STORAGE MODEL

Personality examples must be stored as plain Q → A pairs only.

Recommended structure:

examples/
  mild/
    cats_offended.txt
    bad_coffee.txt
    technology_lazy.txt
  claptrap/
    cats_offended.txt
    bad_coffee.txt

Each file contains:
- A question
- A complete answer
- No metadata
- No explanations
- No rules

------------------------------------------------------------

FAILSAFE BEHAVIOR

If:
- Example loading fails
- Personality mode is unknown
- Eval is unavailable
- Memory is incomplete

Argo must revert to Mild personality automatically.

------------------------------------------------------------

RATIONALE

Rules decay.
Examples generalize.

This design minimizes drift, prevents tone creep,
and allows personalities to be added, removed,
or replaced without refactoring core logic.

------------------------------------------------------------
